Build p-net for Linux using Yocto or Buildroot
==============================================

Yocto
-----
A Yocto layer for building p-net on embedded Linux is available
on https://github.com/rtlabs-com/meta-rtlabs. Usage details are given there.

Add ``p-net-demo`` to your image to include the Profinet IO-device sample
application.


Buildroot
---------
It is possible to use Buildroot for including p-net in your embedded Linux
product.

We intend to publish a Buildroot recipe on https://github.com/rtlabs-com/
(available on request).
